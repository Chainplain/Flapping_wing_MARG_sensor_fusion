# Flapping_wing_MARG_sensor_fusion

The sensor_fusion algorithm locates at the FilterLib  file.

Please find the overall simulations in https://github.com/Chainplain/Flapping_wing_Simu

You can use following steps to test your own algorithm:
1. Download webots https://cyberbotics.com/, the version used is R2021a, however, we are pretty sure you can run it on any version after that.

2. load the worldfile, which is already marked.

3. choose the controller of the robot called the Flapper as SimpleFlapGamma_SensorFusion, which is also provided here. 
This is the controller file, you can rewrite the corresponding classes which are given in other files.

4. If everything is fine, it can be runned right away.

The matlab files are used for figuring.
